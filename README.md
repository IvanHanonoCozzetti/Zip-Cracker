# Zip Cracker
### Cracking tool to unlock zip or rar files passwords using brute force.

#### `zip_cracker.py`
In order to unlock a file just change the `Locked.zip` (inside `crack_zip`) to the name of the file that you are trying to crack.

#### `zip_cracker_1.1.py`
In order to unlock a file change the `yourlist.txt` to the name of your password list and `Locked.zip` to the name of the file that you are trying to crack.

#### `yourlist.txt`
There is a lot of lists with common passwords available online, `rockyou.txt` (14.3 million passwords), shorter 10000 password lists or you can even write a script in order to try all the possible combinations between certain specific characters/digits (this would take much longer to crack, specially if the number of characters/digits is large).
